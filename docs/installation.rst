At the command line run::

    $ pip install libproc

Linux Distributions and Windows
===============================

Libproc is designed to work on OS X as it takes advantage of the kernel
features unique to the xnu kernel. You cannot use it on any other platform. 

Typically you want to use libproc in a platform-dependent version of your
application or library or use a higher-level library that hides this complexity
away from your code.
